Tutoring for c programming

I'm an expert c programmer and have volunteered for the IEEE
as well as led and contributed to production grade software.



Beginner topics:
1. data types, pointers and functions
2. command line ganes
3. brute force equation
4. how to love your preprocessor
5. write a basic shell and command line tools


expert topics:
1. creating production grade asynchronous programs
a. select() and poll()
I. connecting to sockets
II. read() and write()
*catching keyboard strokes
*rrading data from sockets
*writing data to sockets
2. API: using and writing libraries
a. curses, openssl, gmp, libsdl
b. understanding linkers/loaders
c. librarify your own code
3. IEEE and POSIX conpliance
4. Data structures and algorithms
a. quicksort and binary search
b.  divide and conquer algorithms
c. screen drawing algorithms for kernels
5. floating point numbers and numerical literacy 


some of the topics I listed above are very hard to 
find accurate information online on how to do. 
this is not an online tutorial but a list of topics
off the top of my head that I excel at. but more so,
they are topics that are fun to learn with me as I 
show the many follies and pitfalls impossible to avoid 
without help. 



I am fortunate to have learned from one of the best,
if not the best C programmer to have ever lived. 

He would expect me to share it with you as exactingly
and correctly as he did with me
